Software Requirements Specification
Initial Development Schedule
CMSI 4071 Fall 2025
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
====================
The introduction section is great!  Very complete and telling the reader
what your application will do.  Having section 2 also there to describe
the product perspective is somewhat unique and is a good addition.  The
addition of user classes and constraints is also a great idea.  Nice!

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
========================
Strengths
   Extensive coverage of user needs across functional domains.
   Acceptance criteria provide testable outcomes for many stories.
   User-centric language supports empathy-driven design.
   Includes admin and system-level features, not just end-user
      functionality.

Areas for Improvement
   Some stories (e.g., FR15–FR20 on analytics) lack acceptance criteria.
   Could benefit from epics and themes to group related stories for better
      backlog management.
   Dependencies or priorities between stories are not explicitly stated.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
=========================
Strengths
   Clear performance targets for key features.
   Includes reliability and scalability goals.
   Addresses autosave, offline mode, and session timeout, which are
      performance-relevant.

Areas for Improvement
   No mention of load testing, concurrency, or response time under stress.
   Could include performance acceptance criteria tied to specific
      user stories.
   Monitoring and alerting mechanisms are not described.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
=========================
Strengths
   Clear articulation of platform and tech stack.
   Addresses data flexibility (real vs. simulated).
   Includes constraints like bank API limitations and fallback mechanisms.

Areas for Improvement
   No dedicated “Environment Requirements” section (common in traditional SRS).
   Missing details on:
      Supported OS versions
      Minimum device specs
      Network requirements
      Third-party service quotas or limits

   Preliminary Schedule                2/2   your schedule is fine but you
                                             should consider a Gantt or a
                                             PERT chart next iteration
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   10/10 = 100% which is an A-plus


This Agile SRS is well-structured and user-focused, making it highly
actionable for iterative development. To further enhance its utility:
   Introduce epics and themes to organize the backlog.
   Ensure acceptance criteria are present for all user stories.
   Consider adding Definition of Done and test cases for performance
      and environmental aspects.

Make sure you incorporate all the suggestions into the document by the end
of the semester for full credit on this deliverable.

Nice job!
