Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Finance-Buddy
=========================

Proposal Document [3 points]:
-----------------------------
You still need a proposal document in your repository.  I can't evaluate
what isn't there! :D  Make sure you do that and put it into place so I
can give you some feedback on it.  Once it's there, you'll get the points
for the evaluation.

Proposal Presentation [2 points]:
---------------------------------
Your presentation was very good, met all the requirements as listed, and
provided enough detail so the audience saw interested without having so
much text that they couldn't read it all before the next slide appeared.
I enjoyed the presentation and you answered questions well.  Good audience
reception, too.  This will be a #VERY# interesting project!  So many folks
have no idea about how to handle their finances or make a budget, and even
we old folks can use help!

Summary:
--------
Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.

2 out of 5 which is not the best on this deliverable.  Make sure you write
and commit a proposal DOCUMENT for full points.
