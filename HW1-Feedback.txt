CMSI 4071 Fall 2025
======================

SUMMARY:
The essay provides a clear and accurate summary of the ValuJet Flight 592
disaster, capturing the key events, causes, and aftermath.

The essay effectively explains the three types of accidents ~ procedural,
engineered, and system ~ and correctly identifies the ValuJet crash as a
system accident. It also highlights the role of organizational negligence,
regulatory failure, and technical issues.

The essay includes specific details such as the expired oxygen generators,
the lack of safety caps, the presence of flammable materials, and the
ignored FAA warnings.

The writing is well-organized and flows logically from the crash to the
investigation and systemic causes.

The essay goes beyond summarizing by emphasizing the cultural and
organizational failures that contributed to the disaster, not just the
technical ones.

Overall: The synopsis is thorough, accurate, and insightful, effectively
capturing both the factual and thematic elements of the article.

CRITICAL THINKING:
The essay draws meaningful parallels between the ValuJet disaster and
software engineering, particularly in the areas of system design,
testing, and organizational responsibility.

The emphasis on rigorous testing, comprehensive system architecture, and
the dangers of cost-cutting in critical systems shows a strong
understanding of software engineering best practices.

The essay references key practices such as CI/CD, functional and non-
functional testing, and stakeholder responsibility for funding quality
assurance.

The recommendations are practical and align with industry standards. The
emphasis on early architecture planning and continuous testing is
especially relevant.

The section is clearly written and logically structured, with each point
building on the previous one. The conclusion ties the lessons back to the
original incident effectively.

Overall: The application to software engineering is well-developed,
relevant, and grounded in real-world practices, demonstrating a solid
understanding of how systemic failures can be prevented through thoughtful
design and testing.

   Total Percentage:   100 out of 100 which is an A-plus

This essay is a strong and well-structured analysis that effectively
connects the ValuJet Flight 592 disaster to software engineering principles.
It demonstrates a clear understanding of systemic risk, the importance of
rigorous testing, and the ethical responsibility of organizations to
prioritize safety over cost-cutting.

Strengths:
Accurate and engaging summary of the article.
Strong analogies between aviation and software engineering.
Emphasis on architecture, testing, and stakeholder responsibility.
Clear, professional writing and logical structure.

Suggestions for Improvement:
Consider including a real-world software failure (e.g., Equifax breach,
   Boeing 737 MAX software issue) to further ground the discussion.
A brief summary paragraph at the end of the software engineering section
   could reinforce the key takeaways.
